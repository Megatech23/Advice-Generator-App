# Frontend Mentor - Advice generator app solution

This is a solution to the [Advice generator app challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/advice-generator-app-QdUG-13db). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

The app fetches random advice from an external API and displays it on the screen. Clicking the dice button generates a new piece of advice.

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (Fetch API)


### What I learned

While building this project, I improved my understanding of how to use JavaScript to fetch data from an external API and display it dynamically on a webpage. I also learned how to work with asynchronous functions using `async` and `await`.

This project helped me practice DOM manipulation, event handling, and structuring a simple project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also gained more confidence in hosting a project online using GitHub Pages.

### Continued development

In future projects, I would like to improve my JavaScript skills, especially in handling errors and optimizing API requests. I also plan to focus more on making my applications more accessible and improving responsiveness across different screen sizes.

Additionally, I would like to explore adding animations and better user feedback to improve the overall user experience.

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://youtu.be/BT4WzyT2g8k) - This really helped me for deployment in github. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to sincerely appreciate my tutor for the guidance and support provided throughout this learning process. I also acknowledge Techy Jaunt for the opportunity to learn frontend development and for providing a supportive learning environment that made this project possible.
